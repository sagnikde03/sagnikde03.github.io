                <p id="abs-gleam" style="display:none;">Low Back Pain (LBP) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition worldwide and a leading cause of disability, significantly affecting mobility, work productivity, and overall quality of life. Due to its high prevalence and substantial economic burden, LBP presents a critical global public health challenge that demands innovative diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. This study introduces a novel deep-learning approach for diagnosing LBP intensity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from back muscles. A GAN-Convolution-Transformer-based model, named GLEAM (GAN-ConvoLution-sElf Attention-ETLSTM), is designed to classify LBP intensity into four categories: no LBP, mild LBP, moderate LBP, and intolerable LBP. A denoising GAN is central to the model‚Äôs functionality, playing a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of EEG and sEMG signals by removing noise, resulting in cleaner and more accurate input data. Various features are extracted from the GAN-denoised EEG and sEMG signals, and the combined features from both EEG and sEMG are used for LBP detection. After the feature extraction, the CNN is employed to capture local temporal patterns within the data, allowing the model to focus on smaller, region-specific trends in the signals. Subsequently, the self-attention module identifies global correlations among these locally extracted features, enhancing the model‚Äôs ability to recognize broader patterns. The proposed ETLSTM network performs the final classification, which achieves an impressive LBP detection accuracy of 98.95%. This research presents several innovative contributions: (i) the development of a novel denoising GAN for cleaning EEG and sEMG signals, (ii) the design and integration of a new ETLSTM architecture as a classifier within the GLEAM model, and (iii) the introduction of the GLEAM hybrid deep learning framework, which enables robust and reliable LBP intensity assessment.</p>

                <p id="abs-tastenet" style="display:none;">Taste perception is the process by which the gustatory system detects and interprets chemical stimuli from food and beverages, involving activation of taste receptors on the tongue. Analyzing taste perception is essential for understanding human sensory responses and diagnosing taste-related disorders. This research focuses on developing a deep learning framework to effectively recognize basic taste stimuli from EEG signals. Initially, the recorded EEG signals undergo preprocessing to remove noise and artifacts. The CEEMDAN (complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise) method is then applied to decompose the EEG signals into various frequency rhythms, referred to as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). From the chosen IMFs, six distinct entropy features ‚Äî sample, bubble, approximate, dispersion, slope, and permutation entropy ‚Äî are extracted for further analysis. A novel deep learning model, TasteNet, is then developed, integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) module, a multi-head attention module, and the Att-BiPLSTM (Attention-Bidirectional Potent Long Short-Term Memory) network. The proposed architecture classifies the input data into six categories: no taste, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, and salty, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97.52 ¬± 0.48%. TasteNet outperforms existing taste perception classification methods, as demonstrated through extensive experiments. This study presents TasteNet, a robust framework for precise taste perception recognition using EEG signals. Using CEEMDAN for effective signal decomposition and extracting key entropy features, the model captures intricate patterns in taste stimuli. The incorporation of multi-head attention module and the Att-BiPLSTM network further enhances the model‚Äôs ability to identify various taste sensations accurately.</p>

                <p id="abs-slitranet" style="display:none;">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental ailment marked by a loss of interest in activities, persistent depression, and hopelessness. MDD has been on the rise in society in recent decades for varied reasons and has spurred suicidal tendencies among individuals. Early detection, continuous monitoring, and effective treatment are crucial for its impact on quality of life and society. EEG signal models the brain‚Äôs electrical activities and has emerged as a potential tool to assess the depression status of a person. Due to advancements in sensor technology, fast, convenient, and cost-effective EEG acquisition is now possible, resulting in many EEG-based healthcare monitoring applications in recent years. This work proposes an EEG-headset-based smart monitoring system for real-time diagnosis of MDD in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework. In this study, we proposed a novel Linear Graph Convolution Network-Transformer-based deep learning approach for categorizing MDD through a time-frequency analysis of EEG signals. The Stockwell transform (S-transform) is employed to exploit the spectro-temporal information from the EEG and the resulting 2D representation is then fed into customized Linear Graph Convolution Network for MDD detection. We have utilized the Weighted Focal Binary Hinge Loss function, specifically designed for customized Linear Graph Convolution Network, to improve learning and handle unbalanced input. Subsequently, a novel Transformer model is designed to refine the MDD classification further. The proposed methodology named SLiTRANet, blends spectral analysis with the S-transform, graph-based learning with Linear Graph Convolution Network, and the sequence modeling capability of the Transformer. The proposed SLiTRANet model can be further integrated within an IoMT framework for automated real-time MDD diagnosis using EEG signals. The proposed methodology is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, MODMA and HUSM datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed SLiTRANet framework against the existing pre-trained and hybrid deep learning models, achieving remarkable accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision rates of 99.92%, 99.90%, 99.95%, and 99.97%, respectively on HUSM dataset followed by an equally good performance on MODMA dataset with an accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed comprehensive approach implemented on two varied datasets highlights significant advancements in depression detection by outperforming state-of-art approaches.</p>

                <p id="abs-pd" style="display:none;">Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs motor and sensory functions, with early symptoms often involving olfactory dysfunction. Given the importance of detecting these early biomarkers for timely intervention, this letter proposes the novel use of chemosensory EEG for the early detection of PD, as it captures the brain's responses to olfactory stimuli, one of the primary sensory modalities affected by the disease. The proposed method employs an improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise to decompose EEG signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Entropic features, including approximate entropy, sample entropy, and R√©nyi permutation entropy (RpEn), are extracted from these IMFs to identify distinguishing characteristics. These features are then evaluated using several machine learning classifiers. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that combining RpEn features with least squares support vector machine classifier achieves optimal performance, with an accuracy of 96.47%, a precision of 96.14%, and a kappa score of 0.95.</p>
